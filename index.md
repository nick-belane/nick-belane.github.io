Content is written in [Markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/). 
Plain text format allows you to focus on your **content**.

<!--
You can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment element, and they won't be affected by a markdown parser. However, if you create an HTML element in your markdown file, you cannot use markdown syntax within that element's contents.
