I always liked a simple site with just the essential shit, so i make this bad copy of the [phrack](http://www.phrack.org/) layout to use with jekyll and replace my old wordpress blog with a new 1337 [githubpages](https://brerodrigues.github.io).

You can fork, copy, modify, sell, trade for drugs or do whatever you like with this code.
